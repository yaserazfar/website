# Yaser's Portfolio Website

This project was created with React. 

To learn more about React and Web Development, I decided to create a React website. This website is a portfolio of myself, it consists of a landing page, about me, projects and an ideas page.

For this project I used React-MDI components and some bootstrap styling for the ideas' page form.

To see more about the React project and it's uses refer to /REACT.md
