                                    Hey, Iâ€™m Yaser ðŸ‘‹ â€” a software engineer who loves solving problems, building products, and learning something new every day.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Right now, I work at Bankwest, helping build the bankâ€™s onboarding platform. 
                                    I started here as a Technology Graduate, and after rotations in analytics, open banking and payments, 
                                    I am now working as a full-stack developer across an Angular TypeScript frontend and C# .NET backend.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Before jumping into the world of banking, I studied Software Engineering at the University of Waikato, graduating with First Class Honours. 
                                    My honours project focused on making orchard data more useful â€” I partnered with Zespri, Robotics Plus, and Rocos.io to build a React Native mobile app 
                                    that helped growers visualise and understand their data. Along the way, I also worked as a tutor, which taught me that explaining concepts is one of 
                                    the best ways to sharpen your own.     
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I've also interned at a few start-ups:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>21e8 â€” blockchain, networking, high-performance C++</li>
                                    <li>CodeLingo â€” github plugin, Go backend development</li>
                                    <li>Nyriad â€” GPU-driven storage, microservices, React.js</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    Outside of code, youâ€™ll usually find me at the gym, on a basketball court or tinkering with side projects.
                                </p>

                                    At the core, Iâ€™m driven by curiosity and a belief that software is most meaningful when it makes life a little better for people.
                                </p>
